# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
This repository contains solutions to Alx team project on sorting algorithm.

# Meaning of Sorting Algorithms
A sorting Algorithm is an algorithm that puts an array or elements of a list into an order. It uses two methods which are Numerical order and Lexicographical order (alphabetically) and can arrange the elements into either ascending or descending orders. Sorting algorithm is often used to convert data from different formats into the standard format.

# Types of Sorting Algorithm
° Selection sort;
° Insertion sort;
° Quick sort;
° Shell sort;
° Bubble sort;
° Heap sort;
° Merge sort;
° Radix sort (LSD);
° Radix sort (MSD);
° Cocktail shaker sort;
° Gnome sort;
° Bitonic sort;
° Comb sort;
° Bogo sort;
° Cycle sort;
° Strand sort;
° odd-even sort;
° Etc.
The big O is normally used to relatively represent the complexity of different types of sorting algorithms. Let's look at it then.

# Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behaviour of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It can be traced back to the work of Paul Bachmann in 1894.
In the analysis of algorithms, it is used to classify them (algorithms) according to how their run-time or space requirements grow as the input size grows. The letter "O" is used because the growth rate of a function is also referred to as the "Order of the function". A description of a function in terms of a big O notation usually provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function. For example; the best case time complexity of selection sort is O(n^2); insertion, gnome, Tim, bubble sorts, etc are O(n); heap, merge, quick, tree sorts, etc are 0(nlog(n)), etc.
